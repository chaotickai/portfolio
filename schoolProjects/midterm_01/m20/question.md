### Select all correct answers:

1. In HTML a CSS font-family is used to specify a prioritized list of fonts.
2. A font-family is a grouping of fonts defined by shared design styles.
3. Font Families' members are differentiated by a character's shape display (stroke weight, slant, relative width, etc.).
? 4. A best practice for CSS font-family values is to delimit each in quotes if values contain whitespace, as follows: 

`<p style="font-family: "calibri", Garamond, 'Comic Sans MS'; font-size:14pt; font-style:italic">` 
I would pick 4, but calibri has double quotes and I'm not sure if that was intentional or not

5. None of the above
