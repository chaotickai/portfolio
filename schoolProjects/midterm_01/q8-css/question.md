## Question A:

What color would you expect the item Sweet Halwa to show as and why?

<img src="images/1.png" width=45%>
<img src="images/2.png" width=45% style="padding-left:10px;">

### Answer:
I would expect Sweet Hala to be blue because the css selector is more specific.

## Question B:

What color would you expect the item "Sausage" to show as and why?

<div>
   <img src="images/a.png" width=90%>
</div>
<div style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;">
    <img src="images/b.png" width=90%>
</div>

### Answer:
I would expect it to be blue because the id selector takes precedent.
