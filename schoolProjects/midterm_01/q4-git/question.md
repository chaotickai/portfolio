1. What is the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`?

### Answer:
Git fetch allows you to check the meta-data of the remote repository to see if any changes are available. Git pull does the same and then copys any changes to your local repository.

1. Why is the "index" or "staging area" needed in git? Put another way, why do you use the command `git add`?

### Answer:
It allows us to gather related changes into a focused commit as well as allowing us to preview a commit before we actually commit it.
