I gave you 33/34 points overall. The only reason I deducted anything was that there was little to no comments. Keep in mind comments are important not only to show us you know what is happening, but it is a communication for others who may not knwo what is happening with your code.

Overall - WOW!!! Great job. You got the links to work, to you even used the error page correctly.
