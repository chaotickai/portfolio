### Question

The big differences between relational (aka SQL databases) and document based databases (e.g. MongoDB and CouchDB) are all of the following, EXCEPT (pick only one):

2. Document databases allow allow embedding triggers that allow statements to be executed if the data changes.
3. Both allow specifying logical relations between entities (documents or tables), but relational databases can enforce these constraints.
4. The schema flexibility of document databases make them suitable for quick experimentation.
